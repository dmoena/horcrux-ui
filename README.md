# horcrux

Split your file into encrypted horcruxes so that you don't need to remember a passcode

## How it works

Horcrux has two main functions: creating horcruxes and combining horcruxes

### Creating horcruxes

If I have a file called `diary.txt` in my current directory I can select that and split it into horcruxes, creating files like so:

```
diary_1_of_5.horcrux
diary_2_of_5.horcrux
...
```
Now you just need to disperse the horcruxes around the house on various USBs or online locations and hope you can recall where they all are! Or send them to a friend across multiple channels so there's no risk of interception.

### Combining horcruxes

On the receiving end, you can then recombine the hocruxes back together to obtain the original file.

## Installation

via [binary release](https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux-ui/releases)

## Who this is for:
* People who need to encrypt a big sensitive file like a diary and don't expect to remember any passwords years from now (but who paradoxically will be capable of remembering where they've hidden their horcruxes)
* People who want to transmit files across multiple channels to substantially reduce the ability for an attacker to intercept
* People named Tom Riddle

## FAQ
Q) This isn't really in line with how horcruxes work in the harry potter universe!

A) It's pretty close! You can't allow any one horcrux to be used to resurrect the original file (and why would you that would be useless) but you can allow two horcruxes to do it (so only off by one). Checkmate HP fans.

Q) How does this work?

A) This uses the [Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) to break an encryption key into parts that can be recombined to create the original key, but only requiring a certain threshold to do so. I've adapted Hashicorp's implementation from their [vault repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault)

## Alternatives (for command-line)

* [ssss](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/). Works for keys but (as far as I know) not files themselves.
* [horcrux](https://github.com/kndyry/horcrux). Looks like somebody beat me to both the name and concept, however this repo doesn't support thresholds of horcruxes
